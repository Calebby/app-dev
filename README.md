# **BIG BANG THEORY**

My favorite series The Big Bang Theory is a comedy about Leonard and Sheldon, two brilliant physicists with "beautiful minds" who understand how the universe works.[^1] But none of their brilliance helps them interact with others, particularly women.[^1] When a free-spirited beauty named Penny moves in next door, everything changes.[^1]
